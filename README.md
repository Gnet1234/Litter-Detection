The goal of this project is to use a Parrot Anafi drone, and object detection model to improve the efficiency of litter audits. Parrot Anafi was chosen because of its library which allows for communication between the drone, and other devices. This can be done through the Olympe library that is used for communication in the codes. Yolo is being used as the object detection model, for its ease of use and support. 

Parrot Olympe can be installed with this:
pip3 install parrot-olympe

More information about the library can be found here: https://developer.parrot.com/docs/olympe/index.html

Yolo can be installed with this:
pip install ultralytics
